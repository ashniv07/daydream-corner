# vibe-lab

personal + fun projects only.  
nothing serious. nothing production-ready. just my side of the hook.

Sometimes I build random stuff because I can, sometimes because Iâ€™m bored.  
Either way, it lives here.

### things that live here
- ðŸ§ƒ [pixel-garden](https://github.com/yourusername/pixel-garden) â€” tiny generative art thing

---

### the vibe
no deadlines, no readmes that make sense, no rules -> Just my wandering idas in life. 
just code â†’ chaos â†’ maybe a cool output if Iâ€™m lucky.

ðŸ©µ if you somehow ended up here:
youâ€™re either curious or lost. either way, welcome.
